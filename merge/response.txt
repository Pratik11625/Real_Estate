However, here are some steps you could take to find suitable options:\n\n1. **Online Platforms**: Use popular real estate websites like.magicbricks.com, gharpatti.com, or housing.com. Filter your search by location (Chahrol), property type (3 Bhk flat), and price range (upto 70 lakhs).\n\n2. **Local Agents**: Contact local real estate agents in Chahrol who can help you find properties that match your budget. They often have access to off-market or newly listed properties.\n\n3. **Property Brokers**: Use property brokerage services where a professional will search for suitable options on your behalf and negotiate terms with the seller.\n\n4. **Neighborhood Research**: Check if there are any upcoming developments in Chahrol or nearby areas like Kondhwa, Khadki, or Satara Road that might have affordable 3 Bhk flats.\n\n5. **Consult Banks/Financial Advisors**: If you're planning to take a home loan, consult with banks or financial advisors who can help you understand the feasibility of your budget and suggest ways to optimize it.\n\n6. **Negotiate with Sellers**: In some cases, property sellers might be willing to lower their price if they need funds urgently. Be prepared for negotiations.\n\n7. **Check For Amenities**: Ensure that any 3 Bhk flat you find in Chahrol is well-connected and has good amenities like nearby schools, hospitals, malls, and transport facilities.\n\nIf after these steps, you still can't find a suitable option within your budget, consider looking at other nearby towns or suburbs of Pune where property prices might be more affordable."}
